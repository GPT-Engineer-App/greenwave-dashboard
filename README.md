# Welcome to your GPT Engineer project

## Project info

**Project**: greenwave-dashboard 

**URL**: https://run.gptengineer.app/projects/b045397b-6156-4db8-ad1a-7ccf23d72a14/improve

**Description**: "Create a modern, responsive web application for a Recycling Object Detection System using React and TypeScript. This application will serve as a dashboard for monitoring and managing recycling activities. Key features include:

User authentication with JWT
Real-time display of object counts for different recyclable materials
Daily statistics visualization with charts
Alert system for unusual events or threshold breaches
Manual input form for object counts
Detailed statistics page showing system efficiency and error rates
The application should integrate with a RESTful backend API located at https://backengine-nqhbcnzf.fly.dev/api. Use Material-UI for styling and components to create a professional and intuitive user interface. Ensure the design is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

Emphasize a color scheme that reflects sustainability and recycling (e.g., shades of green and blue). Implement proper error handling, loading states, and user-friendly animations to enhance the overall user experience.

The application should be built with scalability and maintainability in mind, following React best practices and utilizing TypeScript for improved code quality and developer experience.

Please start by setting up the project structure and implementing the basic routing and authentication system."
